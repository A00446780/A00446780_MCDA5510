My name is Himanshu Soni. I was born and raised in Jabalpur, MP, India and I did my Bachelor's in CS in this city as well. I have worked at Persistent Systems, Pune, for six months in 2019, as an Apprentice. My role was of a Front-end Web Developer specializing in Angular Framework. After that I took some projects on my own to work as a freelancer, and built Websites with Google Firebase as the Backend, and with Angular Framework for the front-end. 
I have also had a little experience with Android App Development because, during my bachelor's I did my projects on Android apps. And with that I have some knowledge of Java programming as well.
