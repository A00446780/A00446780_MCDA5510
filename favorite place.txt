My favorite place would be the city of Bangalore that I visited with my friends on a group holiday trip in January 2019. I was amazed by the organization, cleanliness, greenery, metro-trains and the wonderful infrastructures of the city. We also visited a theme park called 'Wonderla' in the city and that experience with all my friends was extraordinary.
